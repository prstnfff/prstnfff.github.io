            <p>I'm a data scientist with Amazon.com, based in Seattle, Washington.</p>

            <p>Prior to joining Amazon, I was a research assitant at <a href='https://www.ripl.org' target="_blank">Research Improving People's Lives</a>, a data-driven policy lab based in Rhode Island. I graduated with Bachelor of Arts degrees in mathematics and economics from The University of Chicago in 2015. See my <a href="experience.html">Experience</a> page for more details on my background and skillset.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy distance running, exploring Seattle by bike, as well as hiking and bouldering. I also enjoy expanding my skillset, especially around data visualization and storytelling.</p>
